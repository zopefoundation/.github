# Contributing to zopefoundation projects

The projects under the zopefoundation GitHub organization are open source and
welcome contributions in different forms:

* bug reports
* code improvements and bug fixes
* documentation improvements
* pull request reviews

For any changes in the repository besides trivial typo fixes you are required
to sign the contributor agreement. See
https://www.zope.dev/developer/becoming-a-committer.html for details.

If you cannot sign the contributor agreement you can contribute changes by
placing them in the public domain aka licensing them with
[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). To do this:

* make sure the code changes are your own creation
* provide the changes via pull request or issue comment
* licence the changes as CC0 by adding:
  * This work by \<your name\> is marked with [CC0 1.0 Universal](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0?ref=chooser-v1).

Someone who has signed the contributor agreement can then take the following
steps:

* Lock the issue or the PR to prevent it from changes.
* Copy the code to a new PR. (This step is important as it makes the code a contribution of the other developer.)

Please visit our [Developer
Guidelines](https://www.zope.dev/developer/guidelines.html) if you'd like to
contribute code changes and our [guidelines for reporting
bugs](https://www.zope.dev/developer/reporting-bugs.html) if you want to file a
bug report.
